## 

In the previous lab, we explored the function of Envoy and the need for a control plane to adapt it to a dynamic environment such as a cloud platform utilizing containers or Kubernetes. 

Istio serves as this control plane, enabling the integration and secure connection of Envoy proxies (also known as Istio service proxies, sidecar proxies, or data planes) with deployed workloads. 

Through the control plane's API, users can manipulate the behavior of the network. In this lab, we will begin the process of installing and configuring Istio.
