## When to use a service mesh
A service mesh is a technology that can be used to manage communication between microservices in a distributed system. It provides features such as load balancing, service discovery, and monitoring, and can be used to implement advanced communication patterns, such as retries or circuit breaking.

Consider using a service mesh if you have:

- A large, complex system with many microservices
- A need for fine-grained control over communication between services (mtls)
- A requirement to support multiple protocols
- A need to implement advanced communication patterns (e.g. retries, circuit breaking, canary deployments, ...)

## When to use an ingress controller
An ingress controller is a service in a Kubernetes cluster that allows inbound connections to reach the cluster. It is typically used to expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.

Consider using an ingress controller if you have:

- A smaller system with fewer microservices
- No need for advanced control over communication between services
- A need to expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster

## Istio vs Ingress Kubernetes: The Ultimate Showdown

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Istio</th>
    <th>Ingress Kubernetes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A revolutionary service mesh that will change the way you think about networking, forever!</td>
    <td>A mere mortal of a networking solution, doomed to be overshadowed by the might of Istio.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Features galore, including routing, load balancing, observability, service discovery, and security.</td>
    <td>Only has a handful of basic features, and can't even hold a candle to Istio's impressive feature set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Powered by the unstoppable force of Envoy, the ultimate proxy.</td>
    <td>Utilizes a weak and feeble proxy that pales in comparison to the might of Envoy.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Highly configurable and able to be customized to fit the specific needs of any deployment.</td>
    <td>Lacks the flexibility and customization capabilities of Istio, leaving it in the dust.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The only choice for true networking champions.</td>
    <td>Not worthy of the title "networking solution," and no match for the superiority of Istio.</td>

## Combining ingress controllers and service mesh
In some cases, it may make sense to use both an ingress controller and a service mesh in a Kubernetes cluster. For example, you might use an ingress controller to handle incoming requests from outside the cluster and a service mesh to manage communication between services within the cluster.

## Getting Started with Istio: A Hands-On Lab

This lab is designed to provide a hands-on introduction to Istio, a popular open-source service mesh platform. 

You will learn the basics of Istio and how to use it to manage communication between microservices in a distributed system. 

Through a series of exercises, you will gain practical experience with key Istio features such as load balancing, service discovery, and monitoring. 

By the end of the lab, you will have a solid foundation in Istio and be able to start using it in your own projects. 

This lab is suitable for beginners and assumes no prior knowledge of Istio or service mesh technology.
